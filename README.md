# Pokedex analysis

Analysis of 802 pokemon accross all 7 different generations. The data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon/downloads/pokemon.zip/1

As an avid fan of pokemon as a kid, I wanted to check out the different stats and how each pokemon characterizes himself, so I intend to keep updating this repository with analysis and predictive models.

## Legendary or not-Legendary?

The goal is to use dplyr packages in order to classify pokemons that are Legendary vs. Non.Legendary. Firstly, using Decision trees and Random Forests and then checking other algorithms and different performences.
